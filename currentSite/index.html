<h3>Who are We</h3>
Approximatley 70% of US households own a pet as of 2022, about 90.5 million homes. While there are a lot
of great resources to learn bigger animals like cats and dogs, small animal pet care is flooded with misinformation
and general ignorance that we would like to help alleviate with awareness about small animal toxins.
<br><br>
There are an estimated 232,000 cases of pet poisoning annually in the U.S., 
according to veterinary experts at WebMD Pet Health Center. 
Most of these poisonings can be addressed through owner awareness.

<br><br>
<h3>Misinformation</h3>
A lot of marketing and information about small pet ownership is done by big pet companies such as Petco and Petsmart
in order to convince people that small pets are cheap and easy. Unfortunately, this is generally not the case,
and we're hoping to spread accurate facts so that pet owners can be fully informed and prevent unneeded harm to their
pets.
<br><br>
We know you love you pets just as much as we love ours, so we hope this makes it easier to keep them safe.
